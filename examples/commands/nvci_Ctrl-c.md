# normal, visual, commandline insert mode `Ctrl-c`

## Vim Reference

    :help CTRL-C
    :help v_CTRL-C
    :help c_CTRL-C
    :help i_CTRL-C

## Short Description
Interrupt whatever Vim is doing and/or put Vim back in normal mode.

## Examples
There is actually not much to say about it. It acts like the `<ESC>` key in most cases.
You can use it to quit a commandline call without executing it or interrupt long running processes.
It also ends *insert*, *replace*, *visual* and *select* mode.
