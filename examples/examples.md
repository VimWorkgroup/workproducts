# Vim Alphabet

Vim Alphabet is an example reference for Vim commands, options and functions. The idea is to encourage Vimmers to use
the built-in Vim reference, and making it easier to understand each topic with an example, along with some tips and
use cases.

We try to cover in average one letter per two weeks, so that we finish the 26 letters from the alphabet in 52 weeks
a.k.a. 1 year. After that we continue with the punctuation characters etc.
